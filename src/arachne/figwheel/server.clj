  :explanation "The Figwheel server requires two different types of inputs, wired together using
                the Arachne asset pipeline.

  - Inputs with the `:src` role contain ClojureScript source files to be compiled
  - Inputs with the `:public` role contain files that should be made available via HTTP

  In this case, no inputs with a role of `:role` could be found, and so Figwheel could not be started.

  If you are using the standard asset pipeline DSL, the form to wire up a figwheel server with its
  dependencies should look something like this:

      (a/pipeline [:my/source-code :my/figwheel-server #{:src}
                   :my/html-files  :my/figwheel-server #{:public}])
